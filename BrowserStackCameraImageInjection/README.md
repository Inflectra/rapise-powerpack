This Framework demonstrates how to do 

## Test Camera image capture and QR/Barcode scanning

> BrowserStack enables you to test image capture and QR/Bar code scanning from BrowserStackâ€™s mobile device camera. If your mobile app has features, such as check scanning, profile image capture, and QR/Bar code scanning, you can use this feature to automate the testing of such a feature in your app.
