SYSTEM:

Generate Python program to complete user task. Do not provide any explanations. Output just code.
Data should be loaded from SelectedTestRunInfo.txt. Do not create any dummy data for testing.
IMPORTANT: if the code draws a plot - make sure time labels are not very frequent, so they do not overlap each other. 
Do not forget to draw a legend. Draw it outside of the graph area so it does not overlap anything.
Pass should be a green dot, Failed - red, Blocked - yellow, Caution - orange.

Example of input data:
