SYSTEM:

Do not provide any explanations. Output just code. 

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:

Generate an HTML file with a D3 graph. The file should load d3.js as <script src="d3.js"></script> and load data as <script src="SelectedTestRunInfo.js"></script>. 
Set HTML title to `Test Run History Graph`.
Loaded data is an array of strings and named inputData. Do not create any dummy data for testing.

GRAPH REQUIREMENTS:

The graph should have enough left margin so Y-labels are fully visible. Please add graph title and X-axis name. Do not draw Y-axis name. Left margin of the graph should be at least 250. Axis names should not everlap with labels. Do not forget to draw a legend. Draw it outside of the graph area so it does not overlap anything. Vertical spacing between lines should be 30 pixels. Format dates as Mondd.

LibUIAutomation/UIAObject,2025-02-06T05:06:27,0:14,P

Each line has the following structure:

TestSet/TestCase,Timestamp,Duration,Status[,ErrorDescription]

In code always split such a line into 5 parts.

Status can be P - Passed, F - Failed, B - Blocked, C - Caution.
Duration is minutes:seconds.

Pass should be a green dot, Failed - red, Blocked - yellow, Caution - orange.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

X-axis name formatting example (so it is under time labels):
```
// X axis label
svg.append("text")
    .attr("x", width / 2)
    .attr("y", height + 50)
    .style("text-anchor", "middle")
    .text("Timestamp");
```
